<h1> MachineLearning Project </h1>
In this project, we aim to get familiar with machine learning methods through the Sickit-Learn library and
a datasat containing various movies, series and their info from Amazon and Netflix.
This project has four phases.
In phase zero, we review and analyze the data.
In the first phase, we will get familiar with preprocessing methods and extract features from the text columns.
In the second phase, we use Sickit-Learn library models to predict labels and optimize them.
In the third phase, we'll use Ensemble Learning methods and compare their results with the second phase.
