<h1> HandsOn Project </h1>

<h2> Sudoku </h2>
This program solves a 9x9 sudoku puzzle completely using the genetic algorithm. It first generates a random population and then uses crossover
and mutation to develop new chromosomes. More description available in the report file.


Sample input:

8 0 6 0 0 0 1 0 7\
0 0 0 6 0 2 0 0 0\
0 5 3 0 0 4 8 0 6\
7 0 4 8 0 0 6 3 0\
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\
1 0 0 5 0 0 4 0 0\
0 0 1 2 0 0 7 0 9\
2 0 0 0 9 6 0 0 0\
0 7 0 0 1 0 0 8 0

Sample output:

8 2 6 9 3 5 1 4 7\
4 1 7 6 8 2 9 5 3\
9 5 3 1 7 4 8 2 6\
7 9 4 8 2 1 6 3 5\
5 6 8 3 4 7 2 9 1\
1 3 2 5 6 9 4 7 8\
3 4 1 2 5 8 7 6 9\
2 8 5 7 9 6 3 1 4\
6 7 9 4 1 3 5 8 2

<h2> Checkers </h2>
We've used the minimax algorithm to forsee available steps for each player in the checkers game. We then use an evaluation function to pick the best choice for each player
at his/her turn. Note that the source code was already written and given to us (possibly from the internet!) and we simply implemented the minimax functions and related methods.
