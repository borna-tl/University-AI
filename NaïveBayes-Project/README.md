<h1> NaïveBayes Project </h1>

In this project we aim to classify some advertisements into their representative categories.
We have a sample "divar_train.csv" file which we use to train our naïve bayes classifier. We then use this file to guess the correct categories for each ad in "divar_test" file. 
Finally, we check the estimated and correct result to conclude that we've reached an 85.5% accuracy using additive smoothing method.
More explanation available in the report file.
