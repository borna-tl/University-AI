<h1> NeuralNetwork Project </h1>
This project is all about neural networks and it's done in two parts.


In the first phase, we implement a Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch, using the NumPy library and then we'll use that to train multiple neural networks
and examine the effect of different parameters in the learning process. The dataset used here is the *Cifar-10* dataset 
(for simplicity, only the cats and horses classes are used).

In the second phase, we further explore the various aspects of neural networks using TensorFlow library and Keras high-level interface.
Our goal is to determine the animal species based on the image, using neural networks (MLPs).
We'll use the *Oregon Wildlife Dataset* as our dataset and train a neural network having 4 classes of animals (elk, raven, bald eagle and raccoon).
